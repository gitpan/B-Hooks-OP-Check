BIG FAT WARNING

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a c api for XS modules to hook into the callbacks
    of "PL_check".

    ExtUtils::Depends is used to export all functions for other XS modules
    to use. Include the following in your Makefile.PL:

        my $pkg = ExtUtils::Depends->new('Your::XSModule', 'B::Hooks::OP::Check');
        WriteMakefile(
            ... # your normal makefile flags
            $pkg->get_makefile_vars,
        );

    Your XS module can now include "hook_op_check.h".

FUNCTIONS
  void hook_op_check (opcode type, Perl_check_t cb)
    Register the callback "cb" to be called after the "PL_check" function
    for opcodes of the given "type".
